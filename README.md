# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
The purpose of this assignment was to test our knowledge primary of jQuery. We are expected to make a work day scheduler that displays the current time, has color coded time blocks and can save what the user inputs on the schedule. On this project I spent a lot of time looking through jQuery, Bootstrap and dayjs, the docs on those all were crucial. I did have to meet with a TA and change my code because initially I was running while loops in my “.each()” which itself is a loop. 

## Guidelines 

The acceptance criteria are as follows 
1. The time is displayed up top 
2. There are color coded time blocks depending on if the current time has passed the time block or not 
3. The save button logs the user input 
4. User input stays on the page after refresh 

 
## Overall 

This project was a ton of fun to figure out. I didn’t have to google much here as the docs for everything used laid it all out so clearly. The only issues I had were the looping issue and a small hiccup where the input was saved to local storage but not on refresh.
